              Hello! My name is Matt and I enjoy creating efficient, automated things. Back in 2011,
              I was a construction project manager searching for an affordable document transmittal
              system (think Dropbox on steroids, but before file sharing-services became popular).
              The existing solutions were incredibly expensive at the time, but they seemed so
              simple. How hard could it possibly be to just build one myself?! I had to find out. I
              didn't know the first thing about building software back then, and I vividly remember
              googling{' '}
              <i>
                {`"`}
                how do I save something to the internet.
                {`"`}
              </i>{' '}
              <span role="img" aria-label="Grinning Squinting Face Emoji">
                üòÜ
              </span>
            </p>

            <p>
              Learning new things - in depth - is <strong>by far</strong> my greatest strength.{' '}
            </p>

            <p>
              I built that document transmittal system and absolutely fell in love with software
              development in the process. The app became my pet project for a few years and I
              expanded it into a full-blown social network and project management platform for
              construction professionals before it was acquired. For several years, I worked two
              full-time jobs. I worked my {`"`}real{`"`} job that paid the bills, and then I spent
              every night and weekend at{' '}
              <a href="https://g.co/kgs/sepgCy">my favorite coffee shop</a>, teaching myself how to
              build software.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2016, I started my PhD in Civil Engineering, studying construction productivity. I
              learned a ton about statistics, data science, and artificial intelligence during grad
              school, but I also convinced my advisor to allow me to spend the vast majority of my
              time building software to support our research (way more than 40hr/week!). Software
              engineering was still a full-time job for me during my four years in grad school.
            </p>

            <p>
              When I started my PhD, I thought that I wanted to be a professor. I was excited about
              conducting construction productivity research and teaching the concepts to students.
              However, by the time I finished my PhD, I realized that I was actually much more
              interested in software engineering, so I finally dove all-in on software.
            </p>

            <p>
              In hindsight, it seems so obvious that I would end up in software. I was part of my
              middle school Website Club and I remember taking apart our family computer when I was
              8 years old. I took a circuitious path to get to where I am today, but my previous
              experience in construction management, civil engineering, real estate investing, and
              academic research has given me a unique perspective and a diverse set of skills that
              continuously prove to be invaluable in my career as a software engineer. I wouldn't
              change a thing.
