A web app for applying [the Delphi Method](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255488148_Qualitative_Research_Application_of_the_Delphi_Method_to_CEM_Research) - a group decision-making process - [50x faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEY-Hcdg7vc&t=851s) than traditional methods.

My PhD advisor, [Dr. Paul Goodrum](https://www.chhs.colostate.edu/bio-page/paul-goodrum-6020/), and I were members of [Research Team DCC-01](https://www.construction-institute.org/resources/knowledgebase/10-10-metrics/result/topics/rt-dcc-01) and I built [this app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIQxhofsJeo) to rank order potential future research efforts that could be conducted to improve industry-level construction productivity. We used the app in real-time, in an in-person meeting with 30 Subject Matter Experts, and the outout from the app formed the foundation of [our publication](https://www.construction-institute.org/resources/knowledgebase/10-10-metrics/result/topics/rt-dcc-01).
