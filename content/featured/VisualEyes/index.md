A web app for visualizing and analyzing eye tracking data from the most popular eye tracking hardware vendors.

This app was the foundation of [my PhD dissertation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343178511_Advanced_Eye_Tracking_Analysis_for_Investigating_Construction_Craft_Professional_Interactions_with_2D_Drawings) and [five other publications](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matt-Sears/research). It included [a video player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ed6oByh5tJw) that I built from scratch, [an npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/time-hulls) for analyzing timestamped 2D point data, data cleansing and processing services, and dozens of computed metrics and visualizations that could be exported for further analysis.
