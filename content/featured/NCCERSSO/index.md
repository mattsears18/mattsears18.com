When I joined [NCCER](https://www.nccer.org) in 2019, [Single Sign-On](https://web.account.nccer.org) was the most requested feature from our customers. I evaluated all implementation options, architected a solution, prepared architecture diagrams and documentation, built out the entire backend service, coordinated with half a dozen third-party developers to integrate all of our existing services, built internal dashboards for tracking user migrations to the new service, and coordinated with our customer service team for the rollout. I also served as our "technical translator" for all related executive decision making throughout the process.
